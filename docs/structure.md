# Codebase Structure
The My Pothi codebase is divided into these main sections (not including the folders created by react-native init): 
1. Configuration Files
2. Context files
3. Screens
4. Components

## Configuration Files
Path: ` ./config `

Files that set up configuration for either: 
- the application on startup
- the codebase (primarily typescript)



Files: 
   - defaults.js 
   - types.ts
   - interfaces.ts


## Context Files
