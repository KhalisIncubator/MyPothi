## Description
My Pothi is an app which allows you to create a 'gutka' of your own, in which you can add shabads to. Each line can be manipulated by turning off certain elements (ie translit, etc), increasing font sizes for certain lines, coloring certain lines, and much more. This makes it easier for Kirtanis who wish to create a flow for their kirtan and want to plan out their kirtaan.
